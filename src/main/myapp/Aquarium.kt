//Note: Abstract classes are classes that are partially defined.
//It is the responsibility of the subclasses of the abstract class to define its methods and properties.
// Abstract classes are always open; you don't need to mark them with open.
// Properties and methods of an abstract class are non-abstract unless you explicitly mark them with the abstract keyword.
// If these properties and methods do not have the abstract keyword, then subclasses can use them as given.
// If properties or methods are abstract, the subclasses must implement them.
